This mod offers a fix for the occasional glitch where you cannot pick up a room reward/enter the next door until you have retrieved one of your bloodstones off the ground, or waited for one to refill. This simply recalls them/refills them at the end of the room very quickly, preventing them from inhibiting your progress. This is not legal on any leaderboard or in any current tournament setting.
